Issue Summary:
Duration: August 15, 2023, 08:00 AM - August 15, 2023, 10:30 AM (UTC)
Impact: Our web app went from speedy superhero to sluggish snail, leaving users tapping their fingers in frustration. About 30% of users were stuck in the slow lane during this unfortunate event.

üï∞Ô∏è Timeline:

08:00 AM: Uh-oh, alarms blaring! Monitoring system sees red, response times reaching for the stars.
08:05 AM: Engineering heroes assemble! Alert sounded, capes unfurling.
08:15 AM: First guess: Database got stage fright. Database wizards dive into performance spells.
08:30 AM: Spells fizzled, performance stayed stubborn. Database gremlins giggling.
09:00 AM: Sneaky bottleneck hunt begins. Servers, network, and even a hint of cosmic interference!
09:30 AM: Dead end on the cosmic front. Network tweaks made, but performance snoozes on.
10:00 AM: Bat-signal activated! Senior infrastructure team swings in for the save.
10:15 AM: Senior sleuths spot the CPU caper. Misbehaving server busted!
10:30 AM: Victory! Server restarted, cache confusion cleared, speed restored!
üïµÔ∏è‚Äç Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The sneaky culprit? A cache caper gone wild! Cache's eviction plan set to 'Eject All' mode, causing CPU chaos.

Resolution: Cache caper solved by adjusting eviction plan settings to 'Chill Mode.' Cache calmness restored, CPU crisis conquered. Misbehaving server sent to timeout and brought back in line.

üöÄ Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:

Deploy the Cache Whisperer! More detailed cache metrics under constant watch.
Magic Cache Tests: Automate cache configuration checks before they misbehave.
Heroic Monitoring: Instant alerts for CPU shenanigans and cache confusions.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Cache Crusade: Update cache eviction settings on all servers according to the new playbook.
Cache Magic: Cast spells for automated cache configuration testing within the CI/CD adventure.
Vigilant Monitors: Train the monitoring sidekick to spot CPU capers and cache crises.
Cache Checkup: Examine other servers to nip cache chaos in the bud.
üéâ In a Nutshell:
Picture this: our web app turned into the Flash's slow cousin, making users wish they had super speed to save the day. But fear not! We uncovered a cache caper causing CPU chaos. With settings tuned and the misbehaving server in check, we're back in action. Our Cache Whisperer, Magic Cache Tests, and vigilant monitoring will keep future crises at bay. Stay tuned for smoother web sailing and fewer finger taps of impatience!
